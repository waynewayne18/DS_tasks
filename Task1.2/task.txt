Activity 1.2: (25%) Password Generator
Suppose you are a skilled hacker and are going to crack a password by a brute force attack 
(an attempt to try every possible password). Fortunately, you have obtained the partial 
knowledge about the composition of the passwords, which can reduce the number of the potential 
passwords significantly.

A valid password consists of the elements from a set of capital letters {A, B, C, D,  E},
a set of lower-case letters {a, b, c, d, e}, a set of digits {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and a set of 
special symbols {$, &, %}. However, a collection of rules for composing a valid password are
also gained as follows:
•   it must include at least one element from each category;
•	it must start with letters (capital or lower-case);
•	it must not include more than two capital letters;
•	it must not include more than two special symbols.

You task is to write a Python program, which takes a given number as the password length,
and output all valid passwords (including indices) with the given length. For example, if the 
given length is 4, your program may return the follow result:
1 Aa1$   
2 Ba1$    
3 Ca1$ 
… 

These sets (letters, digits, and special symbols) can be hard-coded or read in if you prefer,
but the given length should be read in from the console for the easy testing. 
The generated passwords should be saved in a file.

Ideas:
go through all like padlock, true bru 5teforce
password must have at least 4 chars     
index[0] always in first 0-9 of the set array
only allow index[0] - [5] if capCounter <= 2, allow index[15] - [17] if specCounter <= 2

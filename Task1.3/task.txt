You are invited to develop a route planning system for a railway logistic company. 
This company is using the UK railway system to deliver cargo to a group of destinations (stations).
However, it has a special policy that the container which carries the cargo can visit each
destination once unless the start station and the last destination station are same. 

For example, the company has an order to deliver one container of cargo to London, Oxford, Bristol,
Birmingham and Exeter. The container starts from London and finally arrives Oxford. 
Your job is to design a system to work out a route to finish the order by the lowest cost. 
The cost and the route details including station names should be outputted or saved in a file.

The company provides a csv file (railway_network.csv) which includes the direct connections of 
the adjacent stations and their weights. For example, the tuple (Bristol Temple Meads, 
Bristol Parkway, 10) denotes that the cost between the two stations is 10 for the either way. 
This data is based on the existing national rail network that is provided as a PDF map. 
Since there are too many stations in London, we have merged all these stations into ONE station 
called ‘London’ in the provided csv file. That is, London is a hub to connect all lines from 
different directions.

Simply speaking, your program should import the railway station data, and it can take a group of 
stations with the start and destination stations and return the lowest cost with the route of 
visiting these stations. Note that each station can be visited once except that the start and 
destination stations are same.
